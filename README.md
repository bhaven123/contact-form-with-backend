# Full Stack Contact Form

## About The Project

This repository contains a simple Full-Stack Contact Form. The aim of the project is to create a contact form that can be integrated into any portfolio or website. The app uses ReactJS for the frontend, it's designed using Material-UI, and uses ExpressJS for the backend server. The frontend project files have been created using `npx create-react-app`. The backend project files have been created using `npx express-generator`. Some cleanup has been done to the folder structures.
